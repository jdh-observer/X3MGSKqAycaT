New Article! @regan008 discusses the @GayGuides project as a tool for scholars. It looks at using the Damron Guides as historical sources, the methods used to create the dataset, and then demonstrates how computational methods can be used to explore facets of this history. [1/4]

@gayguides has spent almost five years digitizing 35+ years of the gay travel guide, Bob Damronâ€™s Address Book. The project hosts an interactive visualization and open access dataset that allow users to explore the rich and complicated histories within these guides. [2/4]

The article discusses the methods, ethics, labor, and considerations that have gone into building such a large-scale dataset derived from historical sources. [3/4] @regan008 explores how this project can be a tool for other researchers through either the interactive visualization or via the open access dataset and computational methods. 

As an example, @regan008 examines the various ways that the Damron Guides signaled danger between 1965-1989. Using pattern matching to identify both explicit mentions of danger and entries that signal danger in a more nuanced manner reveals a steady increase in reports of danger at locations in the 1970s and 1980s.
